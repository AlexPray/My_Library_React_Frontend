      <h1>Conclusion</h1>

      <div className="doc-text-container">
        <p>What I learned, and what would I have done differently?</p>
        <p>
          I made my first steps with React in an own project and worked the
          first time with a backend app and with a database. I learned a lot
          during these hours, and now I know for sure, that <strong>I love to code</strong> and
          to learn new things. I also used Figma for the first time and like to
          design with it. I know my goal to be a web-developer is <strong>achievable</strong>,
          but I still need to learn a lot and to be faster.
        </p>
        <p>
          I think I should have used MongoDB instead of MySQL, since express
          works better with it. And I need to plan my next project better and
          more in depth, to avoid some issues in front. For example, I coded the
          frontend and the backend in the same Visual Studio Code workspace, what leaded to
          issues deploying my project correctly. Why I had to split the project into two partd
          afterwards to fix it. This took time, I could have saved myself.  But <strong> we all make
          mistakes to learn</strong>  from them, right? üòâ
        </p>
        <p>
          At the end <strong>I am happy</strong> with my project and can't wait to continue
          working on it. But first I have to do some work at my workplace and to
          get more practical experience in real projects.
